Contributing
==============

For .hack, choose ~3 ToDo's and implement the functionality. Do this by making a clone on your own computer, make the changes, commit the changes and then push the changes to this repository.

Feel free to change function signatures, create new function etc. But try not to change the general structure too much, the idea is afterall just to try out git. :) 

For anyone interested, feel free to fork this repository and complete the script as you see fit.
